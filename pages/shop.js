These areas include subatomic particles and their corresponding decay equations and electricity formulas and how they work including the doppler effect and Hubbleâ€™s observations on the universes expansion and age (which can all be clipped to create a cheat sheet that suits your personal needs). These topics are all illustrated with colourful pictures and flowcharts so that they can be easily used as a reference point and allow you to build more understanding on what the bigger picture is through visualisation."
